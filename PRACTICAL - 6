AIM:Implement a program to find the winning neuron using MaxNet.

import numpy as np

weight = 0.2
activations = np.array([a1, a2, a3, a4]) def maxnet_iteration(activations, weight):
updated_activations = activations - weight * np.sum(np.maximum(0, activations)) + weight * activations
return np.maximum(0, updated_activations) iterations = 0
while np.sum(activations > 0) > 1:
activations = maxnet_iteration(activations, weight) iterations += 1
print(f"Iteration {iterations}: Activations = {activations}") winning_neuron_index = np.argmax(activations)
print(f"\nWinning neuron: Neuron {winning_neuron_index + 1} with activation
{activations[winning_neuron_index]}")
